          <p className="text-neutral-700">
            In the world of finance, trust and transparency are everything. Investors depend on accurate records,
            smooth settlements, and a system that protects their hard-earned money. But traditional methods of
            record-keeping are slow, expensive, and sometimes even vulnerable to fraud. Enter <span className="font-semibold text-neutral-900">Blockchain</span> –
            a technology quietly rewriting the rules of finance and poised to redefine how the stock market works.
          </p>

          {/* Beyond buzzwords */}
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">A Technology Beyond Buzzwords</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            For many, “blockchain” sounds like a fancy tech term linked only to cryptocurrencies. But its scope is far wider.
            Blockchain isn’t just about Bitcoin or digital tokens—it’s about creating a system of trust without depending on a single authority.
            In a space like the stock market, where billions of rupees move every day, this is nothing short of revolutionary.
          </p>

          {/* What exactly is blockchain */}
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">What Exactly is Blockchain?</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Think of blockchain as a shared digital diary that cannot be erased or rewritten. Instead of one authority holding the diary,
            copies are stored across thousands of computers globally. Every new entry (a “block”) gets locked in and linked to the previous ones,
            creating a chain—permanent, transparent, and secure.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            This means once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be tampered with. For investors, this isn’t just technology—it’s trust in action.
          </p>

          {/* Why should investors care */}
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">Why Should Investors Care?</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The stock market is built on transactions: buying, selling, clearing, and settling trades. Today, this process involves brokers,
            exchanges, banks, and regulators—multiple steps that take time and add cost. Blockchain has the power to simplify all of this:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-3 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Lightning-fast settlements —</span> No more waiting for T+1 delays. With blockchain, settlements can be near-instant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Transparent records —</span> Everyone on the network sees the same verified data, cutting down disputes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Lower costs —</span> Removing unnecessary intermediaries reduces fees and processing charges.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">In short, blockchain can make markets faster, fairer, and more efficient.</p>

          {/* Blockchain meets stock market */}
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">Blockchain Meets the Stock Market</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Around the world, exchanges are experimenting with blockchain. Imagine:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-3 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Real-time settlements in India —</span> Instead of waiting, funds and shares appear instantly in your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Fraud-proof trading —</span> Fake certificates or manipulated records could become history.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Tokenized assets —</span> Own a fraction of real estate, art, or commodities, traded just like shares.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            This isn’t science fiction. Exchanges in countries like Switzerland and Australia are piloting blockchain for clearing and settlement.
            Even Indian regulators are evaluating how blockchain could strengthen investor confidence.
          </p>

          {/* What it means for retail */}
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">
            What Does This Mean for You as an Investor?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">For retail investors, the benefits are clear:</p>
          <ul className="mt-3 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Speed —</span> Faster access to funds and shares.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Security —</span> Transactions that are nearly impossible to tamper with.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Accessibility —</span> Diversify into new asset classes through tokenization.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">In a market where every second counts, blockchain offers a real competitive edge.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">Looking Ahead: The Road to Transformation</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Like every major technological shift, blockchain adoption will take time. Systems must align, regulators must adapt, and infrastructure must evolve.
            But the direction is certain: the future of the stock market will be powered by blockchain.
