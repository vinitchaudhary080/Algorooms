            The Core Idea Behind Algorithmic Trading
          </h1>

          {/* INTRO */}
          <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-700">
            At its foundation, algorithmic trading means letting predefined logic execute trades based on real market data.
            Traders rely on rule-based systems instead of emotional or rushed decision making.
            Parameters such as timing, price, and volume drive execution. The goal remains consistent:
            remove bias, reduce errors, and improve efficiency.
