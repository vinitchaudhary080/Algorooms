          {/* Intro */}
          <p className="text-neutral-700">
            Investors used to rely on instincts, news headlines, and slow decision making. Markets have moved far beyond that. Automation is now the edge. It executes trades in milliseconds, evaluates opportunities nonstop, and removes hesitation that destroys performance.
          </p>

          {/* Section 1 */}
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">
            From Manual Trading to Machine Intelligence
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Humans cannot compete with the speed of data analysis required in modern markets. Automated trading software executes trades based on rules and market conditions, not emotions. It identifies opportunities at the exact moment they exist and acts instantly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Staying competitive now means leveraging machines built to react faster than human reflexes.
          </p>

          {/* Section 2 */}
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">
            The Power of Automation in Wealth Building
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A well-defined strategy only matters if it is executed consistently. Automation removes randomness from behavior and turns every decision into a system. It manages entries, exits, and risk precisely the way the trader intended.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="mt-3 rounded-xl border border-neutral-200 bg-neutral-50 p-5 text-neutral-800">
            Strategy means nothing without discipline. Automation enforces discipline.

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">
            A Smarter Way to Diversify
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Serious wealth is built over portfolios, not lucky trades. Multi-asset algo platforms let traders operate in equities, commodities, and currencies from one dashboard. Multiple income streams, controlled risk, stronger long-term growth.
          </p>

            Intelligence That Works for You
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            AI trading software recognizes patterns that humans overlook. It learns from market behavior, adapts strategies, and suggests actions that rely on logic instead of fear or greed.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            This is not trading. This is smart investing with a learning engine.

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">
            Backtesting and Precision
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Before risking money, traders simulate strategies on historical data to find weaknesses and optimize returns. Combined with real-time execution, every move gains purpose: precise, verified, and timed perfectly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-[18px] font-semibold text-neutral-900">
